# What is this reposity for?
This repository is for me to experiment with GitHub while I learn the Julia programming language.

The code in here will likely be me following various tutorials.

For example, I used [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdhnP00Y1Ks) to learn how to use Julia in VS Code.
